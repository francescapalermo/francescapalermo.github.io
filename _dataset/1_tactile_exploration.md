Tactile and proximity sensing can be efficiently used to perform automatic crack detection. 
The following dataset was acquired with a fibre optic based finger-shaped sensor which slided on a total of 10 different 3D printed surfaces.


4 types of 3D printed surface have been acquired (no crack, crack, bump and wavy pattern).
6 different widths of cracks (0mm, 1mm, 2mm, 5mm, 8mm, 10mm).
5 acquisitions for each surface and width for a total of 50 acquisitions.
Each acquisitions consists of 12 complete movements on the explored surface
