**TIHM** (Technology Integrated Health Management) is a comprehensive dataset developed to support research in **remote healthcare monitoring**, particularly for people living with dementia. The dataset was described in *Scientific Data* (2023) and includes multi-modal data collected continuously from in-home sensors and clinical observations, covering activity, sleep, physiological measurements, and labelled health events. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

TIHM was collected as part of a feasibility study and is openly available for researchers interested in machine learning, digital biomarkers, longitudinal health monitoring, and early detection of clinically relevant events. 

### Information

The dataset comprises:

- Passive in-home sensor data (motion, door sensors) capturing daily activity  
- Sleep monitoring data collected via under-the-mattress sensors  
- Physiological measurements (heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, etc.)  
- Time-aligned labels for health-related events and alerts validated by clinical teams  
- Demographic metadata for participants in the study  

TIHM enables analyses of activity patterns, physiological trends, and behavioural changes over time, and supports predictive modelling for health events in dementia care.
