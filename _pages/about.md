Hello! I am Francesca, a Senior Machine Learning and Computer Vision Scientist at EssilorLuxottica's [Smart Eyewear Lab](https://www.essilorluxottica.com/en/careers/smart-eyewear-lab/), working at the intersection of computer vision, deep learning, and healthcare. My research focuses on on-device intelligence for smart eyewear, with a particular emphasis on context recognition, ego action recognition, human pose and face keypoint estimation, and SLAM for wearable devices.

In my current role, I design and optimise computer vision and deep learning models for edge deployment and TinyML, achieving substantial model size reductions while maintaining competitive accuracy. I lead a collaboration with Politecnico di Milano, managing 4 research groups and 8 projects on smart eyewear, and I co-lead a joint project with Meta on on-device, camera-based context recognition. I also investigate biomarker extraction from RGB eye imaging on-device, including early work on non-invasive glucose monitoring and anaemia detection. I drive innovation and IP generation, with 7 patents submitted and 5 peer-reviewed publications in the computer vision and machine learning domains, and I co-organise workshops (for example ICCV, IJCNN) on smart eyewear and edge intelligence.

Previously, I was a Machine Learning Research Associate at Imperial College London, working with the Care Research and Technology Centre (CR&T) of the [UK Dementia Research Institute](https://ukdri.ac.uk/) (UKDRI) and the [Barnaghi Lab](https://tmi-lab.github.io/). There I developed deep learning models (for example LSTMs and autoencoders) for longitudinal, personalised time-series data collected in collaboration with the NHS, focusing on detecting health-related episodes in people living with dementia and improving model robustness and explainability when learning from unreliable data.

I received my Ph.D. from the [Advanced Robotics Lab](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/robotics/) and the [HAIR Robotics Lab](https://hair-robotics.qmul.ac.uk/) at the School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, United Kingdom. My Ph.D., sponsored by the [National Centre of Nuclear Robotics](https://www.ncnr.org.uk/) (NCNR), focused on multi-modal robotic exploration and fracture detection in extreme environments such as nuclear facilities, combining visual object detection, tactile sensing, and robotic control.

Beyond my roles at EssilorLuxottica and Imperial College, I have contributed to several other research initiatives. I worked on the [NinaPro](http://ninapro.hevs.ch/) and [MeganePro](http://ninapro.hevs.ch/MeganePro) projects, analysing the repeatability of hand movement recognition for robotic prosthesis control using sEMG data. I developed an augmented reality environment in Unity with Microsoft HoloLens to assist amputees during arm prosthesis training, and I applied image segmentation methods to large medical imaging datasets for cancer prediction. These projects strengthened my interest in machine learning for healthcare, wearable systems, and human–robot interaction.

As a Ph.D. graduate in engineering with a focus on machine learning, I have extensive experience with deep learning techniques and architectures across computer vision, time-series analysis, and multimodal learning. My work spans supervised learning, object detection, segmentation, SLAM, and 3D reconstruction, as well as applications in healthcare, recommender systems, and generative models. I primarily work in Python with PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and modern MLOps tools such as Docker and Google Cloud Platform (Vertex AI, Buckets).
