Welcome!<br/>
I am a PhD fellow (2018-current) in the [Advanced Robotics Lab](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/robotics/) 
at the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, United Kingdom. 
My Ph.D. is sponsored by the [National Centre of Nuclear Robotics](https://www.ncnr.org.uk/) (NCNR), 
a consortium of 8 universities whose goal is to develop cutting-edge technology to solve the problem of nuclear waste. 
I am also a member of the [HAIR robotics Lab](https://hair-robotics.qmul.ac.uk/) led by [Dr. Ildar Farkhatdinov](https://farkhatdinov.wordpress.com/).<br/> 


My current research revolves on surface exploration in extreme environment for detecting fractures and additional defects via tactile data analysis.
At the moment, I have developed a multi-modal system for fracture detection and localisation in extreme environments (e.g., nuclear power plant) 
using vision techniques (e.g., object detection) to localise possible locations of fractures. 
These areas are then explored by a fibre optic sensor, attached as an end-effector to a manipulator, 
to confirm the presence of the fracture via online classification methods of the tactile and proximity data.

I have also great interest in application of machine learning techniques to healthcare projects and I have collaborated in the past
to the [NinaPro](http://ninapro.hevs.ch/) and [MeganePro](http://ninapro.hevs.ch/MeganePro) project, 
acquiring DB6 to analyse the repeatability of sEMG classification of hand grasps.
