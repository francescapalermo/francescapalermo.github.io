Hello Everyone!<br/>
I am Francesca Palermo and I am a PhD student (2018-now) in Electronics Engineer and Robotics
at the School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom.
My Ph.D. is sponsored by the [National Centre of Nuclear Robotics](https://www.ncnr.org.uk/) (NCNR) .<br/> 
I am a member of the [HAIR robotics Lab](https://hair-robotics.qmul.ac.uk/) 
and [ARQ lab](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/robotics/) 
run by [Prof. Kaspar Althoefer](https://www.sems.qmul.ac.uk/staff/k.althoefer) .<br/> 
My main research interest is developing haptic and vision techniques for clearing nuclear wastage in extreme environment.
At the moment I am developing a multi-feedback system based on haptic exploration and object detection for fracture recognition in cluttered environments.
