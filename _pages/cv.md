## Work experience <img src="https://github.com/francescapalermo/francescapalermo.github.io/blob/master/images/cv/026-working.png?raw=true" width="48"> 

* June 2021 - Current: Machine Learning Research Associate, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK.
  * Developed **recurrent deep learning** models on personalised data (activity, sleep and physiologycal data) from from remotely monitored environments to detect health-related episodes in people living with dementia.
  * Introduced methods to overcome the limitations of the employed technology, reducing missing data by 5% and leading to **vastly improved** data quality within only six weeks. 
  * Contributed to Machine Learning for Neuroscience module offered to postgraduate students

* September 2018 - Current: Student Demonstrator, Queen Mary Univerity of London, London, UK.
  * Lectured principles of **Machine Learning** and **Data Mining** modules to classes of over 100 students, both undergraduate and postgraduate
  * Supervised over 40 students with biology background and no programming knowledge for an intensive **Python** module.
  * Prepared materials and lectured lessons on frequency and circuit analysis of the **Electronic Sensing** module to classes of over 20 postgraduate students

* February 2020 - May 2020: Computer Vision Internship, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan.
  * Developed a **multi-modal fusion model** with visual and force features for surface fracture recognition implementing object detection technique resulting in two publications.

* May 2019 - June 2019: Machine Learning Assistant, Ocado Technology, London, UK.
  * Short-term work consisting of labelling videos to help in maintenance assistance robot project with multiple tasks, e.g. passing tools to the technician

* July 2017 - June 2018: Research Assistant, HES-SO Haute école spécialisée de Suisse occidentale, Sierre, Switzerland.
  * Applied **machine learning** and computer vision techniques to healthcare projects: 
    1. Developed Hololyo, an **augmented reality** (AR) environment in **Unity** using Microsoft Hololens for amputees to receive visual feedback during the training of arm prosthesis 
    2. Analysed the **repeatability** of hand movement recognition for control of robotic prosthesis based on sEMG data
    3. Researched various features on **Matlab** of more than 2000 CT lung images to find common patterns that could predict cancer
    4. Implement in **Java** a 3D version of the texture snake developed by the Biomedical Imaging Group of EPFL and render it in augmented relity using Microsoft Hololens.

* October 2016 - January 2017: Machine Learning Internship, HES-SO Haute école spécialisée de Suisse occidentale, Sierre, Switzerland.
  * Acquired an **openly available database** for analysis of repeatability of surface electromyography data consisting in a total of 100 acquisitions from 10 subjects. 
  * Implemented **classification techniques** to investigate the data which resulted in a paper accepted to rank A conference and chosen as a finalist for Best Student Award. 
  * In collaboration with the project MeganePro (myoelectric hand prosthesis)
