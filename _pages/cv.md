## Employment 


* June 2021 - Current: Machine Learning Research Associate, Imperial College London, UK.
  * Developed applications in PyTorch and Tensorflow of **deep learning models** (LSTM, Autoencoders) to time-series personalised data collected from remotely monitored environments for detecting health-related episodes in people with dementia.
  * Improved the quality of the data, reducing missing data by 5% within a few weeks.
  * Assisted the laboratories for Machine Learning for Neuroscience module and marked the assignments. [Material available on Github](https://github.com/PBarnaghi/ML4NS).


* September 2018 - Current: Teaching Assistant, Queen Mary University of London, UK.
  * Delivered lectures, practical sessions and marked assignments on Machine Learning and Data Mining to classes from 30 to 200 undergraduate and postgraduate students.
  * Led small group tutorials and provided one-on-one support to students, helping them to understand complex concepts and apply them in practical settings.


* February 2020 - May 2020: Computer Vision Intern, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Japan.
  * Developed a Tensorflow **multi-modal fusion model** for object detection (Faster R-CNN), combining visual and tactile features, resulting in two publications.


* May 2019 - June 2019: Machine Learning Assistant, Ocado Technology, UK.
  * Labelled videos human-robots interactions for use in maintenance assistance robot projects.


* July 2017 - June 2018: Machine Learning Assistant, Haute école spécialisée de Suisse occidentale, Switzerland.
  * Applied machine learning and computer vision techniques to healthcare projects:
    1. Developed Hololyo, an **Augmented Reality** environment using Unity and Microsoft Hololens, to provide visual feedback to amputees during the training of arm prostheses. Utilised IMU data from MYO bracelets to control a virtual rigged hand.
    2. Investigated the repeatability of hand movement recognition for the control of robotic prostheses using sEMG data and **machine learning classification** techniques.
    3. Applied **image segmentation** techniques to more than 2000 CT lung images for medical imaging analysis, extracting features using Matlab to identify patterns that could be used for cancer prediction.


* October 2016 - January 2017: Machine Learning Intern, Haute école spécialisée de Suisse occidentale, Switzerland.
  -	Collaborated with the MeganePro project team. Acquired an openly available database of sEMG data, consisting of a total of 100 acquisitions from 10 subjects.
  -	Applied preprocessing techniques, synchronised and filtered the data, and applied machine learning classification techniques (Random Forest).
  -	Published a paper in rank A conference. Finalist for the Best Student Award.

## Education 


* July 2018 - September 2022: Ph.D. PhD Fellow in Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Advanced Robotics Laboratory, Queen Mary University of London, UK.
  -	Collaborated with the National Centre for Nuclear Robotics for developing a multi-modal robotic surface exploration algorithm for detecting and characterising fractures in extreme environments.
  -	Implemented **object detection algorithms** (Faster R-CNN, YOLO) in Tensorflow to localise a crack in the environment using the video stream from a camera.
  -	Developed an **OpenCV** algorithm for extracting a skeleton version from an image of a crack and using a minimum spanning tree graph to calculate the shortest path for exploring the crack.
  -	Implemented the algorithm in **Python** and **C++**, and used machine learning techniques (Faster R-CNN, YOLO, CNN, Random Forest) to localise the crack and classify the data acquired via a force and proximity robotic sensor.
  -	PhD representative for the 20 students in the Advanced Robotics Laboratory, **organised** biweekly meetings and **mentored** three master students during their final projects.
  -	Participated in the Google Get Ahead 2020 program, an invitation-only program.
  -	Presented demos and projects in outreach activities (Strategy 2030 and Open Days) to **promote** STEM to the public.


* January 2015 - May 2017: M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, University of Rome "La Sapienza", Italy, Mark 110/110.
  -	Implemented **machine learning** techniques (feature extraction, classification) to analyse the repeatability of grasp recognition for robotic hand control based on surface electromyography data.
  -	Developed a mobile application for **Android** that allows the user to send vocal commands and control a Nao Robot, through a client-server connection.
  -	Developed "The Little Knight", a videogame based on **WebGL** using the Javascript library (Three.js).
  - Developed an algorithm for **controlling the pose** of a Kuka manipulator via Mutual-Information Based on Visual Servoing.


* October 2011 - December 2014: B.Sc. in Computer and Automation Engineering, University of Rome "La Sapienza", Rome, Italy, Italian Mark 95/110, 2010-2014
  * Analysis and development of spiking neural network Izhikevich models
