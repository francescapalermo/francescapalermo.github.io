Education
======
* Ph.D. Fellow in Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, EECS School, Queen Mary
University of London, London, UK, 2018-now
* M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, University of Rome "La Sapienza", Rome, Italy,
Italian Mark 110/110, 2015-2017
* B.Sc. in Computer and Automation Engineering, University of Rome "La Sapienza", Rome,
Italy, Italian Mark 95/110, 2010-2014

Work experience
======
* September 2018 - Current: Student Demonstrator
  * Queen Mary Univerity of London
  * Duties included: Marking, Lecture Preparation and Teaching


* July 2017 - June 2018: Research Assistant
  * HES-SO Haute école spécialisée de Suisse occidentale
  * Duties included: 
    1. Develop an augmented reality environment in Unity using Microsoft Hololens and Myo. It will allow amputees
to receive a visual feedback during the training of the arm prosthesis (conference paper in development). 
    2. Analyze the repeatability of hand movement recognition for control of robotic prosthesis based on sEMG data
using a database of 100 acquisitions (journal paper in development). 
    3. Use machine learning technique to study different features of CT lung images of two big datasets to find common pattern that could predict
cancer. 
    4. Implement in Java a 3D version of the texture snake developed by the Biomedical Imaging Group of
EPFL and render it in augmented relity using Microsoft Hololens.
