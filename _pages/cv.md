Education
======
* Ph.D. Fellow in Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, EECS School, Queen Mary University of London, London, UK, 2018-December 2021
  * **Project Proposal**: Robotic surface exploration algorithm developed in Python and C++ implementing vision techniques (object detection, edge detection) and tactile sensing based on force and proximity sensors for fractures detection and characterisation in extreme environments. 
  * Research funded by the National Centre for Nuclear Robotics (NCNR)
  * Additional Activities:
    * Developed the master side of a bilateral teleoperation system via UDP between Geomagic Haptic as master and Franka Panda as slave
    * PhD Representative for the 20 students of the Advanced Robotics Laboratory (ARQ)
	* Organiser of the biweekly meetings for the Advanced Robotics Laboratory
	* Supervised 3 master students during their final project
	* Google Get Ahead 2020 participant, invitation-only program for students interested in developing their technical skills
* M.Sc. in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, University of Rome "La Sapienza", Rome, Italy, Italian Mark 110/110, 2015-2017
  * **Thesis**: Implemented machine learning techniques (feature extraction, classification) to analyse the repeatability of grasp recognition for robotic hand control based on surface Electromyography data
  * **Relevant Projects**: 
    * Nao Interface. A mobile application for Android which allows the user to send vocal commands and control a Nao Robot, through a client-server connection. 
	* Medical Robotics project for controlling the pose of a Kuka manipulator via Mutual-Information Based on Visual Servoing
    * “The Little Knight”. Game based on WebGL using Javascript library (Three.js).

Work experience
======
* September 2018 - Current: Student Demonstrator, Queen Mary Univerity of London, London, UK.
  * Taught  principles of Machine Learning and Data Mining to classes of over 100 students, both undergraduate and postgraduate
  * Supervised 40 students with a biology background and no programming knowledge during an intensive python-based module.
  * Prepared material and taught lessons on frequency and circuit analysis of the Electronic Sensing module to classes of over 20 postgraduate students

* February 2020 - May 2020: Computer Vision Internship, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Tokyo, Japan.
  * Developed a multi-modal fusion model with visual and force features for surface fracture recognition implementing object detection technique resulting in two publications.

* May 2019 - June 2019: Machine Learning Assistant, Ocado Technology, London, UK.
  * Short-term work consisting of labelling videos to help in maintenance assistance robot project with various tasks, e.g. passing tools to the technician

* July 2017 - June 2018: Research Assistant, HES-SO Haute école spécialisée de Suisse occidentale, Sierre, Switzerland.
  * Applied machine learning and computer vision techniques to healthcare projects: 
    1. Developed Hololyo, an augmented reality (AR) environment in Unity using Microsoft Hololens for amputees to receive visual feedback during the training of arm prosthesis 
    2. Analysed the repeatability of hand movement recognition for control of robotic prosthesis based on sEMG data
    3. Researched various features on Matlab of more than 2000 CT lung images to find common patterns that could predict cancer
    4. Implement in Java a 3D version of the texture snake developed by the Biomedical Imaging Group of EPFL and render it in augmented relity using Microsoft Hololens.
  * Supervisor: [Professor Henning Müller](https://www.hevs.ch/en/rad-institutes/institute-of-information-systems/collaborateurs/professor-uas/muller-1609)

* October 2016 - January 2017: Machine Learning Internship, HES-SO Haute école spécialisée de Suisse occidentale, Sierre, Switzerland.
  * Acquired an openly available database for analysis of repeatability of surface electromyography data consisting in a total of 100 acquisitions from 10 subjects. 
  * Used classification techniques to investigate the data which resulted in a paper accepted to rank A conference and chosen as a finalist for Best Student Award. 
  * In collaboration with the project MeganePro (myoelectric hand prosthesis)
