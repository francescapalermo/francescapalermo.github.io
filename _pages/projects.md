Fracture Detection and Localisation
======
Developed an innovative approach involving vision and tactile sensing to detect and characterise surface cracks. 
The proposed algorithm localises surface cracks in a remote environment through videos/photos taken by an on-board robot camera, which is then followed by automatic tactile inspection of the surfaces. 
Faster R-CNN deep learning-based object detection is used for identifying the location of potential cracks. 
Random forest classifier is used for tactile identification of the cracks to confirm their presences. 
The algorithm is able to localise and explore fractures both offline and in realtime.
When using both modalities cooperatively, the model is able to correctly detect 92.85% of the cracks while it decreases to 46.66% when using only vision information. 
Exploring a surface using only tactile requires around 199 seconds. This time is reduced to 31 seconds when using both vision and tactile together. 
This approach may be implemented also in extreme environments (e.g. in nuclear plants) since gamma radiation does not interfere with the basic sensing mechanism of fibre optic-based sensors.
