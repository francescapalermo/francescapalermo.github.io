I have supervised more than seven students at both master and doctoral levels and have served as a Teaching Assistant for several modules in 
<strong>Machine Learning</strong>, <strong>Computer Vision</strong>, <strong>Programming</strong>, and <strong>Electronic Sensing</strong> 
at Imperial College London and Queen Mary University of London.
My responsibilities included preparing teaching material, leading laboratory sessions, supporting students with exercises, and explaining theoretical concepts.
</p>

<p>Below is a list of the modules I assisted, each with a short description.</p>
