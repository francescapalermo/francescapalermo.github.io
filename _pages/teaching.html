I have worked as Teaching Assistant for various modules with a focus on Machine Learning and Data Mining both for Queen Mary University of London and Imperial College London. 
Main responsibilities consisted of preparing materials for the module,supervising students during laboratories, helping them with exercises and explaining the theory of the corresponding module.
Below a list and a short description of the modules that I have assisted with.

<h2><a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/courses/postgraduate-taught/translational-neuroscience/">Machine Learning For Neuroscience (Postgraduate) - Imperial</a></h2>
Machine learning module applied to neuroscience-inspired machine learning, main focus on Machine Learning and Deep Learning models.
<a href="https://github.com/PBarnaghi/ML4NS">Material distributed on Github</a>


<h2><a href="http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/undergraduate/programmes/module-information/items/ecs708pecs708u-machine-learning.html">Machine Learning (Postgraduate) - QMUL</a></h2>
This module consisted on providing a understanding of machine learning methods, including pattern recognition, clustering and neural networks, 
and to allow them to apply such methods in a range of areas.


<h2><a href="http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/undergraduate/programmes/module-information/items/ecs607u-data-mining.html">Data Mining (Postgraduate) - QMUL</a></h2>
This module combined practical exploration of data mining techniques with a exploration of algorithms, including their limitations. 
		

<h2><a href="http://eecs.qmul.ac.uk/undergraduate/programmes/module-information/items/ecs717pecs717u-it-programming.html">Computer Programming (Postgraduate) - QMUL</a></h2>
This module provided an introduction to the principles of programming in the context of designing and constructing complete programs. 


<h2><a href="https://www.sems.qmul.ac.uk/staff/i.farkhatdinov/teaching/">Electronic Sensing (Postgraduate) - QMUL</a></h2>
This module focused on electronic engineering aspects of sensing and instrumentation system: signal theory, metrology, sensing & transduction, signal acquisition and conditioning 
for further processing, analysis, characterisation and design of sensing electronic systems, system-level considerations and sensor data analysis techniques. 


<!-- <h2>Object-Oriented Programming (Undergraduate)</h2>
		Major topics include the concepts of class, object, method, subclass, inheritance and their use in programming. 
		The relevance of the object oriented style with respect to concrete software problems will be stressed both in lectures and labs. 
		There will be two hours of lectures per week, and each student will have a weekly timetabled lab session. 
		In addition, you will be expected to spend further time outside scheduled lab periods in the lab (or at home machines if they are available), and to read textbooks and review notes. -->


<h2><a href="http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/undergraduate/programmes/module-information/items/ecs505u-software-engineering.html">Software Engineering (Undergraduate) - QMUL</a></h2>
This module provided the management principles, theoretical foundations, tools, notation and background necessary to develop and test large-scale software systems. 

<h2><a href="https://github.com/fsmeraldi/c4s-introduction">Coding for Scientists (Undergraduate) -  QMUL</a></h2>
This module provided a hands-on introduction to computer programming, primarily using the popular Python scripting language.
