title: "Repeatability of grasp recognition for robotic hand prosthesis control based on sEMG data"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/1palermo2017repeatability
excerpt: 'Control methods based on sEMG obtained
promising results for hand prosthetics. 
Control system robustness is still often inadequate and does not allow the amputees
to perform a large number of movements useful for everyday
life. 
Only few studies analyzed the repeatability of sEMG 
classification of hand grasps. 
The main goals of this paper
are to explore repeatability in sEMG data and to release a
repeatability database with the recorded experiments. 
The data are recorded from 10 intact subjects repeating 7 grasps 12
times, twice a day for 5 days. The data are publicly available
on the Ninapro web page as the 6th database. 
The analysis for the repeatability is
based on the comparison of movement classification accuracy in
several data acquisitions and for different subjects.'
