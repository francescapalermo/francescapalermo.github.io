permalink: /publication/2omarali2019position
excerpt: 'In this paper we describe how a generic interoperability telerobotics protocol can be applied for master-slave robotic systems operating in position-position, position-speed and hybrid control modes. The interoperability protocol allows robust and efficient data exchange for teleoperation systems, however it was not shown how it can fit switching position and rate control modes. Here we propose the general framework of hybrid position and rate control modes with interoperability protocol. Furthermore, we demonstrate experimentally that the framework is suitable for robotics teleoperation systems in which a human-operator can switch between position-position and position-speed master and slave robots’ workspace mapping.'

In this paper we describe how a generic interoperability telerobotics protocol can be applied for master-slave robotic systems operating in position-position, position-speed and hybrid control modes.
