excerpt: 'Remote characterisation of the environment during physical robot-environment interaction is an important task
commonly accomplished in telerobotics. This paper demonstrates how tactile and proximity sensing can be efficiently
used to perform automatic crack detection. A custom-designed
integrated tactile and proximity sensor is implemented. It
measures the deformation of its body when interacting with the
physical environment and distance to the environment’s objects
with the help of fibre optics. This sensor was used to slide across
different surfaces and the data recorded during the experiments
was used to detect and classify cracks, bumps and undulations.
The proposed method uses machine learning techniques (mean
absolute value as feature and random forest as classifier) to
detect cracks and determine their width.'
