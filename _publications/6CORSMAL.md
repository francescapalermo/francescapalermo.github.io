excerpt: 'We propose a multi-modal method to predict three key indicators of the filling mass: filling type, filling level, and container capacity. 
These indicators are then combined to estimate the filling mass of a container. 
Our method obtained Top-1 overall performance among all submissions to CORSMAL 2020 Challenge on both public and private subsets while showing no evidence of overfitting. '

Human-robot object handover is a key skill for the future of human-robot collaboration. 
CORSMAL 2020 Challenge focuses on the perception part of this problem: the robot needs to estimate the filling mass of a container held by a human. 
Although there are powerful methods in image processing and audio processing individually, answering such a problem requires processing data from multiple sensors together.
The appearance of the container, the sound of the filling, and the depth data provide essential information. 
We propose a multi-modal method to predict three key indicators of the filling mass: filling type, filling level, and container capacity. 
These indicators are then combined to estimate the filling mass of a container. 
Our method obtained Top-1 overall performance among all submissions to CORSMAL 2020 Challenge on both public and private subsets while showing no evidence of overfitting.
